    A custom audio track class. In a typical WebRTC setup, the browser captures
    microphone audio and sends it to the server. This class is primarily
    conceptual for server-side audio generation, processing, or acting as a
    placeholder for forwarding received audio if the server were to mix or
    re-transmit.

    For this audiolms.live demo, the teacher's microphone input comes directly
    from the browser, and the server receives it via the RTCPeerConnection's
    `on_track` event. This class is not directly used for the teacher's
    *sending* audio in this specific browser-based flow.
